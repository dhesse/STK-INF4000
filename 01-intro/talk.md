# Python For Data Science

- Why Python?
    - Easy to learn.
    - Powerful.
    - Widely spread.
    - Lots of useful packages.
- Why coding?
    - Data science means a lot of coding.
    - This code should be 'production grade'.
        - Readable.
        - Reliable.

# What you'll need

- Python
- pip
- virtualenv

---

# Linux

    sudo apt install python
    sudo apt install python-pip
    pip install --upgrade pip

---

# Mac

- [install Homebrew (https://brew.sh)](https://brew.sh)

And then:

    brew install python

---

    pip install virtualenv
    cd my_project
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install matplotlib jupyter
    jupyter notebookbu
    deactivate
