- Sometimes hypotheses can't be tested due to **technical restrictions**.
- Consider the Higgs boson (postulated 1964, discovered 2012).

# So, what does a data scientist do?

- Talk to managers, try to understand the business.
- Find room for improvements, new projects.
- Use data to implement those.
    - Plain statistics.
    - Machine learning.
    - Big data projects.
    - Lots of coding.
- Present findings, convince people to act on them.

# The Project

### Propose a project that involves

- Ingesting data.
- Processing data.
- Making predictions.
- Presenting the results.

### And a motivation.

- Who will use/buy it?

# Python For Data Science

- Why Python?
    - Easy to learn.
    - Powerful.
    - Widely spread.
    - Lots of useful packages.
- Why coding?
    - Data science means a lot of coding.
    - This code should be 'production grade'.
        - Readable.
        - Reliable.

# What you'll need

- Python
- pip
- virtualenv

---

# Linux

    sudo apt install python
    sudo apt install python-pip
    pip install --upgrade pip

---

# Mac

- [install Homebrew (https://brew.sh)](https://brew.sh)

And then:

    brew install python

---

    pip install virtualenv
    cd my_project
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install matplotlib jupyter
    jupyter notebookbu
    deactivate
