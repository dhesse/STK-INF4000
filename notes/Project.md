% STK-INF4000 - Project Work

# The Project

### Propose a project that involves

- Ingesting data.
- Processing data.
- Making predictions.
- Presenting the results.

### And a motivation.

- Who will use/buy it?

---

### The motivation is the most important bit...

... but you can get it **looking at data** available to you.

This is because you should acquire *some* "business acumen".

---

### Proof of work

- There are *no mandatory homework assignments*.
- This means you *should* have enough time for project work.
- I *expect* around 2-3 man-hours/week/team member. 

---

# Data Ingestion

- Web scraping is *probably* enough.
- Downloading data using REST (e.g. Twitter) is *likely* enough. 
- Downloading a .csv file is *not enough*.
    - Enhance your data.
    - Combine e.g. bike sharing data with weather.

---

# Data Processing

- Build a data pipeline.
- Write tests for you pipeline.
- Check data for the right format.
- Check for outliers.
- Test for relevance.
- Apply what you'll learn in the course.

---

# Making predictions: ML

- Apply *at least one* machine learning algorithm to your data.
- Can be supervised or unsupervised.
- Have a good reason *why* you need machine learning.
    - Do you gain something by high quality *predictions*?
    - Or is *inference* your main goal?
- Have ways to automatically measure model performance.
- Have ways to *monitor* model performance.
    - E.g. establish a *baseline model*.
        - Could be a *very simple* ML model.
        - Could be just a *mean* or *median*.

# The "Business idea"

- Who will benefit from your project?
    - NGO?
    - Aid organizations?
    - Do you propose a startup?
    - ... or just a tool?
- How does the data help to accomplish your goal?
    - Do you need good predictions?
    - Do you gain insight with inference?
- You don't have to build the next facebook or stop future ebloa
  outbreaks!
- The business problems are the *starting point* for data science.
    - Thinking aobut these things at all is an important learning
      outcome of the course!
